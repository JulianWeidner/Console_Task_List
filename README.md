# Console_Task_List
A fun task list written in Ruby with accounts!


I wrote this little program to help me understand classes, hashes, classes in external files, serialization, FILE.IO
A few of these concepts I plan to use in my next project, Miny Piggies.

I wanted to use SQL and Bcrypt, but when I was writing the program, I was limited to Repl.it, https://repl.it/@JulianWeidner/Console-Task-List,
so it required some improviziation 

##To Run
You should just have to clone the files, and use the command, ```ruby main.rb``` and the application will run.
Account.rb should be within the same filepath.
